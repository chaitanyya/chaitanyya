Hey I'm Chaitanyya (Chai) -

*Software Correctness · Formal Verification · Reliable Systems*

I am a software engineer and researcher focused on the intersection of formal methods, software reliability, and LLM observability. My work is driven by a central question: how do we build systems whose correctness can be demonstrated, not merely assumed?

I am particularly interested in verification techniques for non-deterministic systems, type-theoretic approaches to software safety, and the emerging challenge of holding stochastic models to rigorous behavioral specifications.

#### Research Interests
- **Formal Verification & Program Correctness** - Techniques for proving software behaves according to its specification, with emphasis on practical applicability in production systems.
- **LLM Behavioral Analysis** - Methods for systematic evaluation, monitoring, and constraint enforcement in large language model deployments.
- **Reliability Engineering** — Design principles for fault-tolerant architectures where failure modes are characterized formally rather than discovered empirically.
